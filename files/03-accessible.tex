\section{Accessible prederivators} 
Here we give the definitions of accessible prederivators using the Yoneda structure
\subsection{Regular prederivators}

\subsection{Density and accessibility}
We recall the following characterization of density:
\begin{theorem}
The following conditions are equivalent  for a functor $G\colon \A\to \B$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $G$ is \emph{dense}, \ie for every object $B\in\B$ the canonical colimit $\varinjlim_{\hom(GX,B)} GX$ is isomorphic to $B$;
	\item the pair $(\id_\B, \id_G)$ exhibits the identity as the left extension of $G$ along itself;
	\item the functor $G^\# = \B(G,1) \colon \B \to [\A^\opp, \Set]$ is fully faithful.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{definition}
A prederivator $\derA$ is \emph{accessible} if it admits a sub-prederivator $S : \mathbb{S} \hookrightarrow \derA$ which is regular and dense.
\end{definition}
